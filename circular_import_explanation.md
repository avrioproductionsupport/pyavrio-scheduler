# Circular Import Error Explanation

## The Problem

There is a circular import dependency between `scheduler.py` and `session.py`:

1. `scheduler.py` imports `Session` from `session.py`
2. `session.py` imports `Scheduler` from `scheduler.py`

This creates a cycle where neither module can fully initialize because each depends on the other being initialized first.

## How Python Imports Work

When Python imports a module:
1. It creates the module object
2. Executes the module's code from top to bottom
3. The module is not fully initialized until all its code has executed

In this case:
- When importing `scheduler.py`, it needs `Session` from `session.py`
- But `session.py` needs `Scheduler` from `scheduler.py`
- This creates a deadlock where neither module can complete initialization

## How to Fix It

There are several ways to resolve this:

1. **Move the Scheduler import inside the method (Recommended)**:
   ```python
   # In session.py
   def get_scheduler(self) -> 'Scheduler':  # Use string annotation
       from .scheduler import Scheduler  # Move import inside method
       return Scheduler(self)
   ```

2. **Type hints with strings**:
   ```python
   # In scheduler.py
   def __init__(self, session: 'Session'):  # Use string for forward reference
       self.session = session
   ```

3. **Create a third module**:
   Create a new module that imports both and handles their interaction, breaking the direct dependency cycle.

Choose method 1 or 2 depending on your needs:
- Method 1 is cleaner if `get_scheduler()` is the only place where `Scheduler` is needed
- Method 2 is better if you need the `Scheduler` type in multiple places in `session.py`

The key is to break the cycle by deferring one of the imports until runtime rather than having both happen during module initialization.
